Project Overview
• Context
We are building an SMS‑based chatbot that interacts with job candidates for a
Python‑developer position
• Goal
Gather/verify information, answer questions, and ultimately schedule an interview
with a human recruiter (or politely end the conversation)
• Main Agent
Manages the dialogue turn‑by‑turn and decides among three actions:
o Continue
o Schedule
o End
• Advisor Agents – Specialized helpers
o Exit Advisor – Confirms when ending the conversation makes sense
o Scheduling Advisor – Checks recruiter calendars (via SQL DB) & validates
proposed slots
o Info Advisor – Handles candidate questions related to the position, May utilize
vector database information related to the position

Main Components
• Main Agent
Orchestrates the conversation with the candidate. In each interaction, it must
determine the appropriate course of action by selecting from the following options:
o Option 1: Continue the Conversation
If the candidate requests additional information or has further questions, the
MAIN AGENT continues the dialogue by exchanging more messages
o Option 2: End the Conversation
If the candidate expresses disinterest (e.g., already found a job), the MAIN
AGENT may decide to conclude the interaction
o Option 3: Schedule an Interview
If appropriate, the MAIN AGENT proceeds to schedule an interview,
confirming date and time with the recruiter
• Supporting Agents ("Advisors")
To manage complexity and maintain modularity, the MAIN AGENT consults
specialized secondary agents (Advisors) at each decision point:
o Conversation Exit Advisor
Evaluates whether it is appropriate to end the conversation. This agent
ensures that uninterested candidates are not unnecessarily followed up with,
avoiding a negative experience
o Interview Scheduling Advisor
Assists in determining whether it’s the right time to schedule an interview. It
checks conversation context, validates proposed times, and may interact with
external tools (e.g., recruiter calendars via function calling)
o Conversation Info Advisor
Helps answering candidate’s questions, formulate the next message and
maintain engagement. Also aims to drive the conversation toward the end
goal: scheduling an interview
• Evaluation Strategy
To assess the performance of the system, a labeled data set of real conversations is
provided. Each response turn is annotated with the correct action the bot should
take:
o End the conversation
o Schedule an interview
o Continue the conversation
These labeled examples should be used to evaluate model performance using
metrics such as:
o Accuracy
o Confusion Matrix

Additional Implementation Steps
• Fine-Tuning
Conversation Exit Advisor should be fine-tuned to detect conversation scenarios
that are expected to conclude
• Embedding
Separately from the main process, we will carry out an offline embedding step,
converting the provided PDF into vector representations stored in a Chroma
database
• Agent Architecture
With LangChain & OpenAI API Endpoint and Models
• Function Calling to interact with the SQL database
When the Scheduling Advisor retrieves available time slots, it analyzes the
conversation context. For example, if the user mentions 'next Friday', it infers the
current date from the time the conversation took place and combines it with the
user's input. Based on this, it then suggests the three nearest available time slots
• Streamlit
Instead of using SMS, the proof of concept (PoC) will be implemented in Streamlit
and deployed to the Streamlit Community Cloud
• Prompting Strategies
o Role’s
o API Parameter
o Instructions Prompts
o Few-Shot Learning
• Evaluation & Testing
Use the labeled test cases to evaluate how well the multi-agent system performs on
End/Continue/Schedule tasks

Project Structure
A Project must have:
• Project Repository, that includes:
o Working with Git (and .gitignore)
o Virtual Environment (.venv and requirements.txt file)
o .env file (environment variables)
o README.md file that includes project documentation, such as:
▪ Project purpose
▪ How to install and run the project locally
▪ Basic usage examples
▪ Project Structure
o App (main application code)
▪ __init__.py file (package initializer)
▪ main.py file (the entry point of the application)
▪ Modules
Application modules, for: main app, Fine-Tuning, Embedding, etc
• __init__.py file
• module.py file (module implementation)
o Streamlit
▪ __init__.py file
▪ streamlit_main.py file (Main Streamlit app)
o Test
▪ test_evals.ipynb - Detailed jupyter notebook with model performance
metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

Important Note
The bot's process includes additional options and complexities that were not
covered here, but had to be simplified for the scope of this project
